# vNES

Original NES emulator located at https://github.com/bfirsh/vNES

I am trying to bring desktop version of this emulator.
But my main target is to deep dive to emulation of retro consoles and understand how it works.
In other words, I'm doing it for educational purposes.

Some global tasks I want to reach:
- [ ] Rewrite in Kotlin
- [ ] Opt out Swing and bring Compose for Desktop.
- [ ] Make it Multiplatform

But before to accomplish global tasks, there is some other tasks to do:
- [x] Add Gradle to project
- [x] Make it run with JFrame instead of Applet
- [ ] Decouple emulator core from UI.
- [ ] Add unit-tests of each logical unit of emulator core
