/**
 * ## A nametable is a 1024 byte area of memory used by the PPU to lay out backgrounds.
 *
 * Each byte in the nametable controls one 8x8 pixel character cell, and each nametable has 30 rows of 32 tiles each,
 * for 960 ($3C0) bytes; the rest is used by each nametable's attribute table. With each tile being 8x8 pixels,
 * this makes a total of 256x240 pixels in one map, the same size as one full screen.
 *
 * ### Mirroring
 *
 * The NES has four logical nametables, arranged in a 2x2 pattern. Each occupies a 1 KiB chunk of PPU address space,
 * starting at $2000 at the top left, $2400 at the top right, $2800 at the bottom left, and $2C00 at the bottom right.
 *
 * But the NES system board itself has only 2 KiB of VRAM (called CIRAM, stored in a separate SRAM chip),
 * enough for two physical nametables; hardware on the cartridge controls address bit 10 of CIRAM to map one nametable on top of another.
 *
 * - Vertical mirroring: $2000 equals $2800 and $2400 equals $2C00 (e.g. Super Mario Bros.)
 * - Horizontal mirroring: $2000 equals $2400 and $2800 equals $2C00 (e.g. Kid Icarus)
 * - One-screen mirroring: All nametables refer to the same memory at any given time,
 *   and the mapper directly manipulates CIRAM address bit 10 (e.g. many Rare games using AxROM)
 * - Four-screen mirroring: CIRAM is disabled, and the cartridge contains additional VRAM used for all nametables (e.g. Gauntlet, Rad Racer 2)
 * - Other: Some advanced mappers can present arbitrary combinations of CIRAM, VRAM,
 *   or even CHR ROM in the nametable area. Such exotic setups are rarely used.
 *
 * ### Background evaluation
 *
 * Conceptually, the PPU does this 33 times for each scanline:
 *
 * - Fetch a nametable entry from $2000-$2FBF.
 * - Fetch the corresponding attribute table entry from $23C0-$2FFF and increment the current VRAM address within the same row.
 * - Fetch the low-order byte of an 8x1 pixel sliver of pattern table from $0000-$0FF7 or $1000-$1FF7.
 * - Fetch the high-order byte of this sliver from an address 8 bytes higher.
 * - Turn the attribute data and the pattern table data into palette indices, and combine them with data from sprite data using priority.
 *
 * It also does a fetch of a 34th (nametable, attribute, pattern) tuple that is never used,
 * but some mappers rely on this fetch for timing purposes.
 *
